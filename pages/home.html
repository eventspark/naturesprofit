		Today you will be playing as Nature's Profit.<br>
		Your goal is to farm enough Aghanim's Scepters to create the legendary Mangonim's Scepter!<br>
		Go on, get farming!

		Tips:
		Last hit creeps (not using your treants) to receive a higher kill bounty!<br>
		When you have all four parts of Aghanim's Scepter, go to your inventory to create an Aghanim's Scepter.<br>
		Use your Agh's to purchase new skills, but beware you will lose the stats (so spend wisely)!<br>
		Purchase recipes to sprout new treants<br>
		Rank up to unlock new skills, items, recipes, etc.
